## 📂 Importing Local Data Files

To import your local data correctly, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Extract the Archive

* Locate the compressed `data` archive.
* Extract (unzip) the archive in the **same directory** as the main executable.

Your directory structure should look like this:

```
/nci_scanner.exe
/data/
   ├── 404.txt
   ├── path.txt
   └── pathkey.txt
```

### Step 2: Verify File Format

* Open the `/data` folder.
* Ensure **all `.txt` files contain valid JSON-formatted content**.
* Update or replace the JSON data inside these `.txt` files as needed.

> The tool automatically detects and processes all JSON-formatted `.txt` files inside the `/data` directory.
